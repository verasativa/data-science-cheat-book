## Freecad navigation with magic trackpad

Magic Trackpad 2 for navigation.
First select Touchpad Navigation Style within FreeCAD (Right Click > Navigation Styles > Touchpad). You may need to Zoom to Fit or Fit All for Zooming to work as desired (rotation around object center).

Pan: Click and hold Shift + Move your finger on the Trackpad
Rot: Click and hold Option + Move your finger on the Trackpad
Zoom: Click and hold Shift + CMD + Move your finger on the Trackpad (I found two-finger scrolling to be too sensitive)

Select: Tap on desired object
Multi-Select: Click and Hold CMD + Tap on desired objects

This also works if you're using a Magic Mouse 2, though its more cumbersome than the Trackpad.

Pan: Click and hold Shift + Move the entire Mouse
Rot: Click and hold Option + Move the entire Mouse
Zoom: Click and hold Shift + CMD + Move the entire Mouse (I found one-finger scrolling on the Mouse to be too sensitive)

Select: Click on desired object using the Mouse
Multi-Select: Click and Hold CMD + click on desired objects using the Mouse
